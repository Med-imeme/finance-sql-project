# üìà Finance SQL Practice Project
This repository was created to **practice and apply** the SQL concepts I learned in the course "SQL for Data Science."

My goal is to demonstrate the **practical use of SQL in finance**, especially in analyzing financial operations, currencies, investments, and company performance using structured queries.

> **NB:** All data are generated randomly using Python.
